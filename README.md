# CIRRHOSIS-PATIENTS-SURVIVAL-PREDICTION
By leveraging machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and random forest, I analyzed extensive medical 
datasets to identify key survival predictors for cirrhosis patients.
Through precise feature engineering and model optimization, I developed a robust predictive model that accurately 
forecasts patient outcomes, aiding clinical decision-making. Collaborating with medical experts and data scientists, I 
gained valuable insights into the integration of healthcare and machine learning, contributing significantly to 
advancements in predictive analytics within hepatology.
